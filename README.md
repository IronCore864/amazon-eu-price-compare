# Known Issue
##### There is some possibility that the price couldn't be fetched, since there are some differences of the DOM structures for different products. Known case is CD products. For it, es, fr, it may fail to get the price.

OK you want to buy something from Amazon in Europe and no doubt you want the best price.

I guess if you are a frequent Amazon user in Europe you must have already known that among the european countries Amazon has not 1, but 5 different online markets, and they are: amazon.de, amazon.es, amazon.fr, amazon.it and amazon.co.uk.

And I think you are no stranger to the fact that most of the time they have different prices for the same product.

So let me describe normally what you would do:

1. Open amazon.de (maybe uk, es, fr, it; depends on where you live and what's your native language)
2. Search the product you want
3. Copy the name of the product
4. Open 4 new browser tabs for amazon.es, amazon.it, amazon.fr, and amazon.co.uk
5. Paste the name you copied from step 3 to the 4 tabs you just opened
6. Switch between the 5 tabs for different Amazon markets and see which is the cheapest.

You see where I'm going with this?

Is it annoying that you have to open 5 tabs to search the samething?

You must have been tired of searching the same product in 5 markets to see which one is the cheapest everytime you need something, no matter it's something ninety nine or something several thousands and hundreds and ninety nine.

Well you are saved now.

This extension helps you to do that: you just go to any Amazon EU market, say, amazon.de, search the item, then click the icon of this extension(a black letter B, which stands for "B"est price) and it shows you the price in es, fr, it and uk Amazon.

Just a single click and you get the best price. No fuss, no muss.
