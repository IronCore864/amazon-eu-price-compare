# FAQ

## What Is **Amazon Best Price Europe**

It's a Chrome broswer plugin, which works only on Amazon product detail page, to search the same product from all the other Amazon European markets for the lowest price. Rank of the product in its own category can be included as an option (default off).

## I'm Rich. I Do Not Care Too Much About Price. Should I Still Use It?

Yes. Because it makes the world a better place.

## I'm Very Sensitive about My Personal Data. Does This Plugin Follow the GDPR Rules?

Of course. I'm surprised you asked. I handle data with care. This plugin doesn't collect a single piece of data.

The only permission this plugin need is to be allowed to run on Amazon European market websites, and talk to a [third-party API](https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/*) to get currency exchange data.

This plugin also requres permission to use storage, and it is used purely for storing your options for this plugin.

As of now, the only option is to enable/disable the product category rank in the result as well.

## It's THE Best Plugin I've Ever Used. But the User Interface Looks Like Something from the 1990s. Can You Beautify It?

No. Reasons:

A) I believe function over aesthetic. For example I prefer CLI to GUI whenever possible. And this plugin works perfectly fine.

B) Frontend developing is only my personal hobby and due to my career change I do not plan to spend much time on it in the near future.

## I Do Not Live in Europe. Can You Add, for Example, amazon.com, amazon.es, etc.?

No.

This plugin is intended for European buyers only.

Adding non-European markets make no sense, because even if the price there is much cheaper, the shipping cost plus import tax will render the price advantage meaningless.

## Amazon Just Opened A New Market In Europe And It Is Xxx. Can You Add That Country As Well?

Yes. Send me an Email, let me know, and I will do it.

## I'm in EU, but I'm a Seller, Not Buyer. Will This Plugin Bring Values For Me As Well?

Yes, because you can easily search your product or your competitors' product easily to get an overview of the prices in all European markets then react to it.

## I'm an EU Seller. For My Personal Interest I Really Want to Know the Price in Non-European Amazon Markets. Please Add Other Markets?

No.

But you can Email me; and maybe I can develop another plugin specifically for you. Adding non-European markets to THIS plugin is out of the question.

## I Do Not Use Chrome. Is There a Firefox Version?

Yes and no.

Yes because I do have it; see [here](https://github.com/IronCore864/amazon-eu-price-compare-ff).

No because I do not maintain it anymore.

## Why Stopping Maintaining The Firefox Version? You Think Chrome Is Better Than Firefox?

No. My choice is only personal. It doesn't mean which browser is better.

## Why You Do Not Mention You Stopped Maintaining the Firefox Version in That Repo?

I'm lazy.

## It's THE Best Plugin I've Ever Used. I Want to Help You to Commercialize It.
